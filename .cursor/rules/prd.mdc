Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project Name: Smart Day Planner

⸻

1. Overview

Smart Day Planner is a responsive web application designed to help users plan their day in a fun, effective, and intelligent way. Users input their top tasks for the day, and the app leverages an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate an optimal, time-based plan with justifications for the schedule.

⸻

2. Goals
	•	Provide users with a fast and intuitive way to prioritize their daily tasks.
	•	Use AI to generate a reasoned and optimal schedule.
	•	Present the output in a visually fun, simple, and engaging format.
	•	Ensure compatibility across all screen sizes (mobile-first design).

⸻

3. Features

3.1 Task Input Interface
	•	Text input with multiple rows (or one at a time with add button)
	•	Input validation (e.g. min 1 task, max 10 tasks)
	•	Optionally use icons or auto-suggestions to categorize tasks
	•	“Plan My Day” button triggers LLM scheduling

3.2 Loading State
	•	Display a fun animated spinner or progress bar while waiting on AI-generated plan
	•	Include “thinking…” or “planning your perfect day” messaging

3.3 AI-Powered Schedule Generator
	•	Use a simple LLM (e.g., OpenAI, open-source) to:
	•	Detect mandatory tasks (e.g., specific meetings)
	•	Consider dependencies and time-of-day relevance (e.g., school hours)
	•	Group similar tasks (e.g., outdoor activities)
	•	Provide justifications for order of events

3.4 Visualization Output
	•	Timeline or vertical list format with:
	•	Time blocks
	•	Task descriptions
	•	Fun icons or emojis
	•	Optional rationale text (e.g., “we chose this time because…”)
	•	Option to “Replan” or “Start Over”

⸻

4. UX/UI Requirements
	•	Mobile-first responsive design using a modern UI framework (e.g., Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
	•	Clean, minimalist style with playful accents (emojis, color, animations)
	•	Accessible font sizes and touch targets for mobile
	•	Light/Dark mode toggle (optional)

⸻

5. Technical Requirements

Frontend
	•	Framework: Next.js (preferred for SSR and flexibility)
	•	UI Components: shadcn/ui or similar
	•	State Management: React hooks / context
	•	Mobile Responsiveness: Tailwind CSS / media queries

Backend / API
	•	Language Model: OpenAI GPT or local model via API call
	•	Scheduling Logic: Simple rule-based prompts combined with LLM reasoning
	•	Hosting: Vercel or Netlify

⸻

6. User Flow
	1.	User visits site (mobile or web)
	2.	Enters list of things they want to do today
	3.	Clicks “Plan My Day”
	4.	Sees a loading spinner (backend calls LLM)
	5.	Receives an animated plan, showing:
	•	Time blocks
	•	Activities
	•	Reasons for order
	6.	Can refresh plan or enter new tasks

⸻

7. Stretch Goals (V2 Ideas)
	•	Drag-and-drop editable timeline
	•	Voice input for tasks
	•	“Motivate Me” feature with affirmations or AI coaching
	•	Integrate calendar export (Google Calendar, iCal)
	•	Daily reminders or mobile push notifications

⸻

8. Success Criteria
	•	Users can easily input tasks and receive a schedule
	•	LLM consistently provides sensible, reasoned plans
	•	Works smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop
	•	90%+ users report the plan feels “helpful” or “fun to use”
